# Custome-Object-detection-using-YOLOv8

# ðŸš€ Overview
This project demonstrates how to train a custom object detection model using YOLOv8 to detect cars in images. YOLOv8, developed by Ultralytics, is a cutting-edge object detection model known for its high accuracy and real-time performance.

# ðŸ’» Project Workflow
1. Import Libraries of python like numpy, matplotlib,YOLO,cv2,torch.

2. Prepare the Dataset
Collect images containing cars.
Label the dataset using Roboflow or LabelImg in YOLO format (.txt files).
3. Train the YOLOv8 Model
4. Evaluate Model Performance
5. Test the Model on New Images
6. Deploy the Model for Real-Time Detection

# ðŸ“ˆ Results & Performance
Achieved high accuracy in detecting cars in various lighting conditions.
Optimized hyperparameters to improve detection precision.
Real-time object detection works smoothly on both images and videos.
Future Improvements
Extend the model to detect multiple vehicle types.
Optimize model size for deployment on edge devices.
Implement tracking for vehicle movement analysis.

#  â›³ Conclusion
This project successfully trained a YOLOv8-based object detection model for car detection. By following these steps, you can modify the workflow for detecting other custom objects.
